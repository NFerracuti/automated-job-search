RESUME TEMPLATE GUIDE

This file explains how to create a Word template (.docx) for use with this system.
You'll need to create a template with merge fields that match the structure in resume_data.json.

Steps to create a template:
1. Open Microsoft Word and create a new document
2. Design your resume layout with proper formatting, fonts, margins, etc.
3. Instead of static text, add merge fields where dynamic content should go

MERGE FIELD NAMING CONVENTION:
Use these exact names for the merge fields to match the resume_data.json structure:

Personal Information:
- {{ personal_info.name }}
- {{ personal_info.email }}
- {{ personal_info.phone }}
- {{ personal_info.location }}
- {{ personal_info.linkedin }}
- {{ personal_info.github }}
- {{ personal_info.portfolio }}

Summary:

Skills:
- {{ skills_text }} (This is a comma-separated list of all skills)

Experience (use in a loop/table):
For each position:
- {{ experience[0].title }}
- {{ experience[0].company }}
- {{ experience[0].location }}
- {{ experience[0].dates }}
- {{ experience[0].description[0] }} (First bullet point)
- {{ experience[0].description[1] }} (Second bullet point)
- etc.

For the second position, use experience[1], and so on.

Education (use in a loop/table):
For each entry:
- {{ education[0].degree }}
- {{ education[0].institution }}

Certifications (use in a loop/table):
For each certification:
